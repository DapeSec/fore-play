## Description

Fore Play is a mobile app built with React Native and Expo that simplifies scheduling golf dates with your friends. Easily find available tee times and organize your next round on the course.

## Getting Started

This guide helps you set up a local development environment to run the Fore Play app on your device or simulator.

## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine (https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)
